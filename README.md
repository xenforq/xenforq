<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## 👋 I'm William Hallin
I'm William Hallin, a young freelancer located in the northern Sweden city named Skellefteå. *(it's a lovely place, I must admit)*

I got myself interested in the world of digital art (graphics & motion design) at the age of 10, but it wasn't until I was 14-years-old that I decided to aim to make this something long term for myself. Thank my 14-year-old self for being here currently. 💛

As my days passes by, I spend any free-time I can find experimenting with digital design and video production to let me find new and creative ways to build the stories I want to tell. I'll go ahead and open up my After Effects and play around with some of my stock footage, or go outside and experiment with my camera and its settings to achieve [that](https://assets.super.so/williamhallin.com/images/1cf3b0aa-4a30-47b4-8cec-1b5de7113290.jpg) image. *(well maybe not that, but you get the point)*
